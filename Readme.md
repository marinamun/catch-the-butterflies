## Main Functionalities


**Player Control:** The player can control their character's movement using the arrow keys (e.g., KeyA, KeyD, KeyW, KeyS) to navigate through the game world.

**Obstacles:** Mosquitos act as obstacles in the game. If the player's character collides with a mosquito, they lose a life.

**Defense Mechanism:** The player can defend themselves against mosquitos by pressing the spacebar to eliminate them and prevent losing lives.

**Extra Lives:** Hearts appear as collectible items in the game. When the player collects a heart, they gain an additional life.

**Score:** The player's score increases with each butterfly they successfully catch. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible.

**Game Over:** The game ends when the player runs out of lives. At this point, the game displays a "Game Over" screen, revealing the player's final score.

**Winning Condition:** A winning condition may exist, such as reaching a specific score (e.g., catching 50 butterflies) to win the game.

**Sound Effects:** The game includes various sound effects, such as background music, collision sounds, and shooting sounds, to enhance the gaming experience.

**Restart:** Players can restart the game after a game over by clicking the "Start Again" button.

**Favicon:** A custom favicon is set to enhance the game's branding and appearance in web browsers.


## Backlog functionalities:
